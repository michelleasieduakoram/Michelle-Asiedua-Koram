# Featured Projects
### [Advanced DNS Tunnelling & C2 Detection](https://github.com/michelleasieduakoram/Advanced-DNS-Tunnelling-and-C2-Detection/)
**Tools:** Elastic Stack(Elasticsearch,Kibana KQL), Suricata, Filebeat, Docker, Python 3, tcpdump 

**Highlights:**
- Built a DNS lab to simulate tunnelling and C2 behaviour.
- Parsed DNS logs and PCAPs to identify suspicious domains and high-entropy queries.
- Mapped detections to MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., T1071.004 – Application Layer Protocol: DNS).

### [Cloud Identity Compromise & IAM Abuse Investigation using AWS](https://github.com/michelleasieduakoram/Cloud-Identity-Compromise-IAM-Abuse-Investigation)
**Tools:** AWS CloudTrail, AWS CLI, IAM  

**Highlights:**
- Used CloudTrail lookup-events and AWS CLI to trace suspicious logins and policy changes.
- Investigated role assumptions and privilege modifications for potential account misuse.
- Documented findings with MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to credential access and privilege escalation.

### [Network Phishing Detection & Suricata Integration](https://github.com/michelleasieduakoram/Network-Phishing-Detection-and-SMTP-Exfiltration-Monitoring)
**Tools:** Suricata, Splunk, Flask(Python), MailHog 

**Highlights:**
- Simulated a full phishing attack using Flask, Suricata, Splunk, and MailHog.
- Created custom Suricata rules to detect HTTP POSTs and SMTP exfiltration.
- Built Splunk dashboards correlating network and SIEM logs.
- Troubleshot network capture and IDS configuration issues.
